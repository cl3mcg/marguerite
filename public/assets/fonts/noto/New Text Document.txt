All fonts are in ttf format. All fonts are variable fonts.
All fonts files are located in the following folder path:
'/assets/fonts/noto/NAME_OF_THE_FONT.ttf'

I would like you to also add a src for a woff and woff2 files that I will add later in the folder.
So down the line your src should looke like this:
  src:url("/assets/fonts/noto/NAME_OF_THE_FONT.woff2") format("woff2-variations"),
      url("/assets/fonts/noto/NAME_OF_THE_FONT.woff2") format("woff-variations"),
      url("/assets/fonts/noto/NAME_OF_THE_FONT.ttf") format("ttf-variations"),
      url("/assets/fonts/noto/NAME_OF_THE_FONT.ttf") format("ttf");

Help me to adapt the code provided previously.
Make sure to adapt the unicode range also.
