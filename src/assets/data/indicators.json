    "longDescription": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a critical measure of inflation, indicating how the prices of a representative basket of consumer goods and services are changing over time. Monitoring CPI is essential as it affects purchasing power, cost of living, and economic policy decisions. An upward trend in CPI suggests increasing inflation, reducing consumers' purchasing power and possibly leading to tighter monetary policy. Conversely, a downward trend could indicate deflation, which might lead to economic stagnation or recession, prompting policy measures to stimulate the economy."

High inflation can erode purchasing power and savings, while low or negative inflation can signal weak demand and economic distress. Policymakers use inflation data to adjust interest rates, aiming to control inflation without stifling economic growth. Persistent inflation can lead to higher interest rates, affecting loans and investments, whereas deflation can lead to lower rates but also signal economic weakness."
