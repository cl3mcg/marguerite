# Marguerite project

A simple workbench for freight forwarding related ideas and projects.

## Project brief

The purpose of this project is to create a simple agnostic workbench to throw ideas and projects. All projects are related to freight forwarding, the industry I currently work in.

## Technical details

### Introduction

Marguerite is a project based on web technologies.

#### Backend

The backend of Marguerite is based on an Express server that would handle API requests as well as async operations (document handling, emails etc.).
The backend is stored in a separate **private repository** for now.

#### Frontend

The frontend of Marguerite is based on Vue.js and is made to be reactive and interactive as possible.
The syntax is based on Vue.js 3 with the composition API in order to write simple code and most importantly to allow me to improve on my Vue.js skills.

The frontend is (by default) not using any CSS or component framework in order to practice and improve my CSS skills.
When necessary, unstyled components from PrimeVue would be used (e.g. date picker component).

## Documentation

For the time being, the documentation of this project would be listed below, but ultimatly it should be moved to a dedicated space.
**The project has been moved from GitLab to GitHub in Oct-2023.**
